1. turn off realtime protection
2. run setup as admin
3. open akebiLauncher
4. make sure genshin is on windows mode
5. type anything on the enter license key
6. f1 to open menu(menu can be only opened once youre fully entered in the game)

if it says like error internet/headers:
1. open cmd and type `ipconfig /flushdns`
2. make a new empty text file named "hosts" and remove .txt extension and just paste it at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` and run setup.bat again

**proof that this does work:**
