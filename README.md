1. turn off realtime protection
2. run setup as admin
3. open akebiLauncher
4. make sure genshin is on windows mode
5. type anything on the enter license key
6. f1 to open menu(menu can be only opened once youre fully entered in the game)

if it says like error internet/headers just try exit and open akebi again

**proof that this does work:**
